# grunt-shrinkpack

> Provides a task for Shrinkpack to run. Requires grunt-shrinkwrap to run before grunt-shrinkpack, as Shrinkpack uses the json file generated by Shrinkwrap.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-shrinkpack --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-shrinkpack');
```

Then add shrinkpack as a subtask within a defined build:
